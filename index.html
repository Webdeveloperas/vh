        </p>
        <p>Hello,<br>Thanks for stopping by. I am Violina Mitev, an artist based in High Barnet, London, UK.
          I think the world is a wonderful place to be. I see beauty and inspiration everywhere – in the little things surrounding us, in our thoughts, in our bodies, faces and gestures. I have found that through painting I am sometimes able to
          capture these little drops of wander. For all of us to enjoy and appreciate.
        <p><i>“Everything I do in art applies to life as well: focusing on the joy, learning to be ok with letting go, embracing the contrast, bringing quiet space in to balance out the frenzy, finding out your own unique voice, showing up
            consistently,
            becoming an adventurer of possibility, taking imperfect action, bringing play back into our lives.”</i>
          Tracy Vertugo, artist</p>
